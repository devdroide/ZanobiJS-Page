description: Application Basics
---

In this series of articles, you will learn the basic fundamentals of ZanobiJS. To familiarize ourselves with the
basic components of the applications, we will create an application that will display the result
of the consumption of a service.

## Language

We love TypeScript and nodeJS. That is why ZanobiJS is built under this technology and takes advantage of the latest
Language features for creating microservices.

## Requirements

NodeJS (version >= 16) must be installed on your machine.

## Setting

Setting up a new project is pretty easy with ZanobiJS-CLI. With npm installed you can create a new project
with the following commands in your OS terminal:


```bash title="Installing CLI and creating new application"
npm i -g @zanobijs/cli
zanobijs new app_name
cd app_name
npm install
```

:::note
ZanobiJS is focused on microservices and if you want to create an AWS lambda application,
use the following command:

```sh title="Creating a new AWS lambda application"
zanobijs new name_app --AWSLambda
```
:::

This will create the app_name directory, subdirectories, and several main files.
which are important for its operation.

```bash title="Project structure"
├── app_name
|  ├── __test__                       // Folder to unit test
|  ├── build                          // Folder where the application construction would be
|  ├── dist                           // Folder where the typescript transpilation is stored
|  ├── src                            // Source code
|  |  ├── app.module.ts                // Main module in ZanobiJS
|  |  ├── example.controller.ts        // Example controller in ZanobiJS
|  |  ├── example.service.ts           // Example service in ZanobiJS
|  |  ├── index.ts                     // ZanobiJS main file
|  ├── package-lock.json              // History file of installed packages
|  ├── package.json                   // Project setup
|  ├── tsconfig.json                  // Working configuration file for TypeScript transpiler
└── ...

```

In the index.ts file it contains a function, which starts the application

```js title="index.ts default application"
import { Factory } from "@zanobijs/core";
import { AppModule } from "./app.module";
import { ControllerExample } from "./example.controller";
const factory = new Factory(AppModule);
const app = factory.create();
const bootstrap = () => {
  const controllerExample = app.get<ControllerExample>(
    "ControllerExample"
  );
  console.log(controllerExample.getHelloService());
}
bootstrap();

````

```js title="index.ts AWS Lambda application"
import { Factory } from "@zanobijs/core";
import { AppModule } from "./app.module";
import { ControllerExample } from "./example.controller";
const factory = new Factory(AppModule);
const app = factory.create();

exports.handler = async (event: any, context: any) => {
  const controllerExample = app.get<ControllerExample>(
    "ControllerExample"
  );
  console.log(controllerExample.getHelloService());

  return {
    statusCode: 200,
    body: JSON.stringify("Hello from lambda")
  };
}

````

To create a ZanobiJS application, we use `Factory` which makes it easy for us to explore and configure the classes
using metadata. With the `create()` method the dependency injection container of the `awilix` library is generated
and records what was found during the exploration.
