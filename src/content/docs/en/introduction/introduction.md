ZanobiJS is a small framework for creating scalable and efficient Node.js server-side applications. It uses progressive JavaScript, it is built with TypeScript.

It is initially intended for use in clouds such as AWS and Azure, however it can also be used traditionally.

It is strongly inspired by nestjs and angular, deep down it uses awilix as a dependency injection container which is extremely powerful and effective.

### Install

To get started, you can use the ZanobiJS CLI, it will help you structure the project by creating a new directory and will populate it with the core files and supporting modules, creating a conventional base structure for your project.
