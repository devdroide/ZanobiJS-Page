Enter the terminal and enter the following command:

```sh
npm install -g @zanobijs/cli
```

##### 2. Create an application

Now let's create an application:

```sh

```

:::tip[Did you know this?]
You can shortcut the command [new] with [n] simply
:::

If everything goes well in your terminal you will be able to see "ðŸ˜Ž SUCCESS - The application app_name was created correctly"

##### 3. Entering the application

Let's enter the application folder and install its dependencies:
