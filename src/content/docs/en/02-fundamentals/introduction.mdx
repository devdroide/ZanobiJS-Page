ZanobiJS is a mini-framework for building server-side applications with NodeJS that are scalable and efficient.
It uses JavaScript but is built with TypeScript.

It is initially intended for use in clouds such as AWS and Azure. however, it can also be used traditionally.

You will find things similar to [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) and [Angular](https://angular.io/),
and it is because ZanobiJS is inspired by those frameworks. However, not everything will be the same.

Finally, ZanobiJS uses [Awilix](https://github.com/jeffijoe/awilix/) which is a container for
Extremely powerful and effective dependency injection.

### Entities

Within ZanobiJS there are features called entities:

<CardGrid stagger>
<Card title="Components" icon="document">
   They process the request and the application response.
</Card>
<Card title="Services" icon="add-document">
   They contain the business logic.
</Card>
<Card title="suppliers" icon="open-book">
   Provide basic data to controllers or services.
</Card>
<Card title="Modules" icon="setting">
     Organize and add entities to the DI container.
</Card>
</CardGrid>


Each of these has a responsibility and are very important for the functioning of the framework.

### Structure of a small application

In this image you can see in a very superficial way what a small application looks like and how it works.

<Image src={imgAppEsDark} alt="App-Es Dark" />

We see that there is a main module in which the entities are registered. however, there may be other modules in the application.

ZanobiJS can also be modular as this makes it easier to organize and scale.

:::note[Remember]
* A module can contain another module
* A driver to a service and/or provider
* A service to a service and/or provider

But a controller should not contain another controller, nor should services be used from the 
handler [Handler] or launcher [bootstrap].

The above for good practices.
