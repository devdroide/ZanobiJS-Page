The mini-framework is composed of 2 main dependencies:

1. @zanobijs/core
2. @zanobijs/common

<Image src={imgFundamentalsAppEs} alt="App-fundamentals-Es" />

### ZanobiJS Common

Here we will find the decorators that record the information of the classes in the metadata,
in order to be able to add them to the dependency injection container later.

```js
import { Controller } from "@zanobijs/common";
@Controller()
export class ControllerExample {...}
```

```js
import { Injectable } from "@zanobijs/common";
@Injectable()
export class ServiceExample {...}
```

### ZanobiJS Core

In this dependency we are going to find the factory that is responsible for executing an injector, this searches
Within the metadata the entities are going to be injected for.

It then creates the dependency injection container and registers the entities found.

Finally, after creating an application from the factory in the index.ts it gets the entity
through the [get] method that generates a request and the container resolves it.

```js
import { Factory } from "@zanobijs/core";
import { AppModule } from "./app.module";
import { ControllerExample } from "./example.controller";
const factory = new Factory(AppModule);
const app = factory.create();
const controllerExample = app.get<ControllerExample>(
  "ControllerExample"
);
console.log(controllerExample.getHelloService());
// "Hello from services"
```
