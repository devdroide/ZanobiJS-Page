```js title="Example controller"
import { Controller } from "@zanobijs/common";
import { ServiceExample } from "./example.service";

@Controller()
export class ControllerExample {
  constructor(
    private sExample: ServiceExample,
  ) {}

  getHelloService() {
    return this.sExample.getHello();
  }
}
