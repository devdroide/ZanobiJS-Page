Services are an important part of our framework and are designed so that they can be injected as a dependency.

### Dependency injection

ZanobiJS is based on a design pattern known as **dependency injection**. Thanks to
[Awilix](https://github.com/jeffijoe/awilix/) dependency container can be managed quickly,
efficient and powerful.

```js title="Example service"
import { Injectable } from "@zanobijs/common";

@Injectable()
export class ServiceExample {
  constructor() {}
  getHello() {
    return "Hello ServiceExample";
  }
}
```
In the following example, we see that dependency is resolved within the constructor of a controller.

```js title="Controller constructor example"
// Inject the service into the controller
constructor(private sExample: ServiceExample) {}
```
